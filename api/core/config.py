"""This module is concerned with handling settings with environment variables.

The settings are created using a Pydantic class that reads environment variables from a `.env` file in the
`/api` directory if it is available.

Example `.env` file:
```
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=123
DB_HOST=postgres
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=fastapi
SECRET_KEY=d751923806645de8f6f6376798574ef844bb6d6d5ca36a8224718a84c775ad19
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTE=30
```

Although it is recommended to use a .env file if deploying docker-compose, the settings will also read from
environment variables that are defined in the current terminal session.

Example creating the environment variables through the terminal:
`$ export DB_USER=postgres`
